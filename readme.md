# Reinforcement Learning - Learned Indicators

This repository aims to train a 'portfolio management' algorithm, using learned indicators for smart profit/risk balancing.

Stocks will be iterated through over time, and as long as the dataset is in a dictionary of DataFrames format, you should be able to use any tickers you'd like.
